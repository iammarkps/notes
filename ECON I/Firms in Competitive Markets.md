# Firms in Competitive Market

## Perfect Competition

Perfect competition is when all the firms in the market produce the same good, and take the price from the market. Thus, we call them a **price taker**.

| Revenue Type | Definition |
| -------------| ---------- |
| Total Revenue (TR) | $TR = P \times Q$ |
| Average Revenue (AR) | $AR = \frac{TR}{Q}$ |
| Marginal Revenue (MR) | $MR = \frac{dr}{dq}$ |

When a firm is competitive $P = AR = MR$.

Firm wants to [[The Costs of Production#^27864f | maximize their profit]], from marginal analysis we came to the conclusion that the profit will be maximize for $Q$ where $MR = MC$. If $MR > MC$ then we can increase $Q$ because the revenue gain from that marginal unit is larger than the cost to produce that unit, and vice-versa.

### Firm's decision

- **Shutdown**: $Q=0$, but still need to pay FC, but FC is sunk cost, so we need consider to shutdown only when $TR < VC$, or $P < AVC$. (SR)
- **Exit**: Leave the market. Reduce $TR$ to $0$, so we consider shutting down if $TR < TC$, or $P < ATC$ (LR)
