# The Costs of Production

When a firm produces goods, they want to maximize their profit. We define profit as $$P = TR - TC$$ ^27864f

Where we define total revenue as $TR = pq$. Cost can be categorize in two category

- Implicit Costs
	- Ignored in accounting
	- Opportunity cost
- Explicit Costs
	- Real costs (Ex. Money)

So total cost is $TC = Implicit \,Costs + Explicit \,Costs$, then profit can be categorize to *economic profit* and *accounting profit*

- Economic Profit is defined as $P = TR - TC$
- Accounting Profit is defined as $P = TR - Explicit \, Costs$

When we define costs as a mathematical function, we can have $TC = FC + VC$. (FC: Fixed costs, VC: Variable costs)

| Measures of Cost | Definition |
| -----------------| ---------- |
| Fixed Cost (FC) | Does not vary with $q$ |
| Variable Cost (VC) | Vary with $q$ |
| Total Cost (TC) | $TC = FC + VC$, $TC = Implicit \,Costs + Explicit \,Costs$|
| Average fixed cost (AFC) | $\frac{FC}{Q}$ |
| Average variable cost (AVC) | $\frac{VC}{Q}$ |
| Averaage total cost (ATC) | $\frac{TC}{Q}$ |
| Marginal cost (MC) | $\frac{d(TC)}{dQ}$ |

For a typical cost curves, $MC$ crossess $AVC$ and $ATC$ at it lowest points. When $MC > ATC$ $ATC$ will increase and vice-versa. $ATC$ is U-shaped.

For short run (SR) some inputs are fixed, but for long run (LR) all inputs are varaible.

Because we can shift ATC in the long run for most efficient mix of inputs, LRATC or Long-run average total cost will enclave SRATC.
