# Firms in Competitive Market

## Perfect Competition

Perfect competition is when all the firms in the market produce the same good, and take the price from the market (They don't have individual demand curve). Thus, we call them a **price taker**. They can freely entry or exit the market.

| Revenue Type | Definition |
| -------------| ---------- |
| Total Revenue (TR) | $TR = P \times Q$ |
| Average Revenue (AR) | $AR = \frac{TR}{Q}$ |
| Marginal Revenue (MR) | $MR = \frac{dr}{dq}$ |

When a firm is competitive $P = AR = MR$. In perfectly competitive market $MR$ will be horizontal because increase in $Q$ does not change the price.

Firm wants to [[The Costs of Production#^27864f | maximize their profit]], from marginal analysis we came to the conclusion that the profit will be maximize for $Q$ where $MR = MC$. If $MR > MC$ then we can increase $Q$ because the revenue gain from that marginal unit is larger than the cost to produce that unit, and vice-versa. Note that, $MC$ determines firm's $Q$, so $MC$ curve is firm's supply curve. ^64ecf6

### Firm's decision

- **Shutdown**: $Q=0$, but still need to pay FC, but FC is sunk cost, so we need consider to shutdown only when $TR < VC$, or $P < AVC$. (SR) ![[sr-outcome.png]]
- **Exit**: Leave the market. Reduce $TR$ to $0$, so we consider shutting down if $TR < TC$, or $P < ATC$ (LR)

### Zero-Profit condition

Profit is define with [[The Costs of Production#^27864f | P = TR - TC]], or $P =(ATC - P) * Q$

When the entry or exit process is complete, that is $P=ATC$ due to there are no incentive for firm to enter or leave the market, the firm left in market will have zero-economic profit.

Firm will produce if $MR=MC$ from [[The Costs of Production#^d8e29e]], $MC$ will cross $ATC$ at $min(ATC)$. In the long run $P = min(ATC)$, which is called **efficient scale**.

### SR and LR Effects of an increase in demand

Increase in demand will increase profit in short-run, ![[sr-curve.png]] but due to free entry nature of perfect competition firm can freely enter the market and shift the supply curve and reduce $P$ to restore long-run equilibrium.
